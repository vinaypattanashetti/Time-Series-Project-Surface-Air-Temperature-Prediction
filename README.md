# Time-Series-Project-Surface-Air-Temperature-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to predict the surface air temperature for the next month based on historical monthly mean temperatures. By using both SARIMA and LSTM models, we aim to leverage both statistical and machine learning approaches for time series forecasting and compare their effectiveness with the XGBoost Classifier.
